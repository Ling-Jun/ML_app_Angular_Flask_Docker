# ML-Application-with-Flask-Angular-Docker
Developing a machine learning application from start to finish, utilizing Flask for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and Docker for deployment. 

We'll illustrate the process using a simple example of predicting height based on weight, but the principles discussed can be implemented in any machine learning application.

Within this project, we construct a basic regression model and a straightforward web application using Angular. The provided instructions are customized for Linux-based operating systems.
